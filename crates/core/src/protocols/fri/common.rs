		// here is the down-to-earth explanation of what we're doing: we want the terminal
		// codeword's log-length to be at least as large as the Merkle cap height. note that
		// `total_vars + log_inv_rate - sum(fold_arities)` is exactly the log-length of the
		// terminal codeword; we want this number to be ≥ cap height. so fold_arities will repeat
		// `arity` the maximal number of times possible, while maintaining that `total_vars +
		// log_inv_rate - sum(fold_arities) ≥ cap_height` stays true. this arity-selection
		// strategy can be characterized as: "terminate as late as you can, while maintaining that
		// no Merkle cap is strictly smaller than `cap_height`." this strategy does attain that
		// property: the Merkle path height of the last non-terminal codeword will equal the
		// log-length of the terminal codeword, which is ≥ cap height by fiat. moreover, if we
		// terminated later than we are above, then this would stop being true. imagine what would
		// happen if we took the above terminal codeword and continued folding. in that case, we
		// would Merklize this word, again with the coset-bundling trick; the post-bundling path
		// height would thus be `total_vars + log_inv_rate - sum(fold_arities) - arity`. but we
		// already agreed (by the maximality of the number of times we subtracted `arity`) that
		// the above number will be < cap_height. in other words, its Merkle cap will be
		// short. equivalently: this is the latest termination for which the `min` in
		// `optimal_verify_layer` will never trigger; i.e., we will have log2_ceil_usize(n_queries)
		// ≤ tree_depth there. it can be shown that this strategy beats any strategy which
		// terminates later than it does (in other words, by doing this, we are NOT terminating
		// TOO early!). this doesn't mean that we shouldn't terminate EVEN earlier (maybe we
		// should). but this approach is conservative and simple; and it's easy to show that you
		// won't lose by doing this.

		// see https://github.com/IrreducibleOSS/binius/pull/300 for proof of this fact

		// how should we handle the case `fold_arities = []`, i.e. total_vars + log_inv_rate -
		// cap_height < arity? in that case, we would lose nothing by making the entire thing
		// interleaved, i.e., setting `log_batch_size := total_vars`, so `terminal_codeword` lives
		// in the interleaving of the repetition code (and so is itself a repetition codeword!).
		// encoding is trivial. but there's a circularity: whether `total_vars + log_inv_rate -
		// cap_height < arity` or not depends on `cap_height`, which depends on `n_test_queries`,
		// which depends on `log_dim`--- soundness depends on block length!---which finally itself
		// depends on whether we're using the repetition code or not. of course this circular
		// dependency is artificial, since in the case `log_batch_size = total_vars` and `log_dim
		// = 0`, we're sending the entire message anyway, so the FRI portion is essentially
		// trivial / superfluous, and the security is perfect. and in any case we could evade it
		// simply by calculating `n_test_queries` and `cap_height` using the provisional `log_dim
		// := total_vars.saturating_sub(arity)`, proceeding as above, and only then, if we find
		// out post facto that `fold_arities = []`, overwriting `log_batch_size := total_vars` and
		// `log_dim = 0`---and even recalculating `n_test_queries` if we wanted (though of course
		// it doesn't matter---we could do 0 queries in that case, and we would still get
		// security---and in fact during the actual querying part we will skip querying
		// anyway). in any case, from a purely code-simplicity point of view, the simplest approach
		// is to bite the bullet and let `log_batch_size := min(total_vars, arity)` for good---and
		// keep it there, even if we post-facto find out that `fold_arities = []`. the cost of
		// this is that the prover has to do a nontrivial (though small!) interleaved encoding, as
		// opposed to a trivial one.
